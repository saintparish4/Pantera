feat: implement pricing engine service layer with multi-strategy support

Implement a comprehensive pricing engine service layer that supports
multiple pricing strategies using the strategy pattern.

Features:
- PricingEngine: Central coordinator that registers and manages all
  pricing strategies with validation and error handling
- CostPlusStrategy: Simple markup pricing with percentage or fixed
  markup, optional tax calculation, and min/max price bounds
- GeographicStrategy: Location-based pricing with regional multipliers,
  currency mapping, and support for country/region codes
- TimeBasedStrategy: Time-of-day and day-of-week pricing with surge
  pricing support based on demand thresholds
- RuleBasedStrategy: Flexible rule-based pricing with conditional
  logic supporting multiple actions (discount, markup, multiplier,
  fixed amount, set price)

Tests:
- Unit tests for PricingEngine with all strategy types
- Comprehensive tests for each strategy including edge cases
- Validation error handling tests
- Boundary condition tests (min/max prices, negative values)
